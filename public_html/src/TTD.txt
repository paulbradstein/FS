Wow Animation to Carousel Text and Thumbnail Images
Nano-Gallery
Basic Navigation
Amazon CDN Hosting

ADDITIONAL BELLS / WHISTLES
To get nano-gallery like hover effects on thumbnails, you will probably need to do W3schools.
    All it will do is change opacity on hover. not sure how to get text to appear, disappear on hover.
Try to get parallax scrolling w/ carousel. Would need to use background images for carousel. If using stellar.js, it seems to require jquery 1.9.x or 2.x
To get navbar animation - need to add classie and cbpAnimatedHeader JS files, cbp class in css, cbp-af-header to navbar div. 
    It requires an earlier version of jquery (1.9.1 is working). Navbar is already collapsed so not sure I would use this.
